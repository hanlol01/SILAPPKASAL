## 1. Project Snapshot

SILAPPKASAL is a secure reporting and case-handling platform for prevention and response to sexual violence in a university environment. The repository is structured with a Laravel REST API backend in `backend/api` and a React frontend in `frontend/`.

The backend is the current source of implemented business behavior. Frontend integration, evidence upload, notifications, analytics, WhatsApp integration, and Flutter work remain future work unless explicitly promoted.

## 4. Core Implementation Principles

- Backend code is scoped to `backend/api`.
- Existing project docs remain source of truth.
- Sensitive narrative fields are encrypted using Laravel encrypted casts.
- Admin and Super Admin access remains metadata-first unless a milestone explicitly grants sensitive access.
- Decision records are an explicit exception: Admin and Super Admin may read full decision content.
- Assigned Satgas access is required for sensitive case, investigation, recommendation, decision, recovery, and monitoring details.
- Anonymous report identity is not stored.
- Evidence file upload, download, preview, storage implementation, attachments, WhatsApp, notifications, analytics, and Flutter integration are not implemented yet.
- Tests are expected for each milestone before completion.

---

## 5. Security and Privacy State

Current security posture:

- Sanctum Bearer token auth is active.
- Token expiry is configurable through `SANCTUM_EXPIRATION`.
- Inactive users are rejected by auth flows.
- RBAC is project-defined through roles, permissions, policies, and middleware.
- Reports support anonymous and identified intake.
- Anonymous reports do not store reporter identity, reporter phone, IP, or device data in report business fields.
- Admin report/case/investigation/recommendation reads are metadata-first.
- Admin and Super Admin decision reads include full decision content because Milestone 9 records institutional decision output.
- Admin and Super Admin manage recovery lifecycle in Milestone 10.
- Assigned Satgas can read sensitive case, investigation, recommendation, decision, recovery, and monitoring detail only for active assignments.
- Assigned Satgas remains read-only for decision records.
- Assigned Satgas may create monitoring entries for assigned cases, but cannot complete or discontinue recovery.
- Evidence metadata and chain-of-custody foundation is implemented for assigned Satgas only.
- Admin and Super Admin have no default evidence access in Milestone 11; future break-glass access remains possible but is not implemented.
- Evidence file upload/download/storage is not implemented.

Deferred security work:

- Strict security headers middleware.
- Persistent audit log implementation.
- Break-glass access.
- Break-glass evidence access and secure file streaming.
- Notification privacy review.
- Frontend token/session hardening.

## 7. Next Milestone

After Milestone 11 is committed, the next milestone should be planned as:

```text
Milestone 12 - Audit Log Foundation
```

Expected focus:

- Persistent audit log model.
- Critical action event recording.
- Relationship to auth, reports, cases, investigations, recommendations, decisions, recoveries, and evidence metadata actions.
- Privacy-safe audit resources and RBAC controls.
- No notifications, WhatsApp, analytics, or frontend integration unless explicitly approved.

## 8. Recommended Handoff Commands

Run from `backend/api`:

```bash
php artisan about
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --force
php artisan route:list --path=api/v1
php artisan test
```

Expected verified test baseline:

```text
71 passed
```

Recommended verification commands:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --force
php artisan route:list --path=api/v1
php artisan test
```

## 9. Handoff Notes for Next Agent

- Read all relevant docs before planning a new milestone.
- Do not modify `frontend/` during backend milestones unless requested.
- Do not change Phase 1-4 docs unless explicitly approved.
- Before running migrations in a milestone implementation, show files created/modified, migration summary, route summary, and test summary when requested.
- Keep privacy and RBAC behavior conservative.
- Do not seed dummy users or business rows unless the milestone explicitly requires it.
- Keep business logic in services, access rules in policies, validation in form requests, and response shaping in resources.
